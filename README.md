# Nerf_Project
This repository contains my reimplementation of NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) as part of my Deep Learning seminar at the University of Haifa. NeRF is a model for 3D scene reconstruction, capable of synthesizing new views of a scene from a set of 2D images.

Project Highlights:
âœ… Full NeRF implementation from scratch following the original paper
âœ… Experiments to enhance performance, including:

Different positional encoding strategies
The effect of sharpening techniques on reconstruction quality
âœ… Comparative analysis between my implementation and the original model
Results & Learnings:
Explored the impact of architectural modifications on NeRFâ€™s rendering accuracy
Gained insights into 3D vision, neural networks, and volumetric rendering
Optimized model performance while maintaining high perceptual quality

ðŸ“‚ Code & Implementation: Available in this repository
